Repository for supporting files for the Budget96 keyboard. All are as-used for the GB production unless otherwise noted as asjusted or modded.  

Included in this are:

 - Middle slice files: Available in DXF and SVG.
 
 - Hirpro slice files: Not on hand at the moment, will be requesting copies from Jolimon to add shortly. 
 
 - Top/bottom plate files: Available in DXF, Kicad project files, or Gerbers ready for fab. Note on the Kicad project files, both top and bottom are their own components that will need to be added to the project when opened if they don't appear automatically. 
 
 - Picture showing the physical layout support of the plates.
 
 - DWG file for the physical PCB layout that will show the PCB outline and *should* also show the mounting hole locations. 
 
 
Hardware used:

 - M3 flathead screws x20. 10x 12mm and 10x 6mm are used for hipro boards. Non-hipro will have all 20x screws be 6mm. Ideally the width of the head should be 5.3mm or more such that they are not easily pulled through the holes in the plates. Most M3 screws should work fine as long as the head width is observed.
 
 - M3 hex standoffs x10. The GB boards and the middle slice files are designed for 8mm long *brass* hex standoffs that are approximately 4.7mm wide. For the "skeleton" style setup with no middle slices I'm using 9mm tall *nylon* hex standoffs that are approximately 5.5mm wide to not be pulled through the screw-holes in the plates. 
 
 - The bumpons I include are just standard .25" wide .079"(5/64") self-adhesive bumpons, but anything works really. 
  
 - The bottom plates are compatible with cone-style feet that usually come with flathead M5 screws.
