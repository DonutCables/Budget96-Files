Repository for supporting files for the Budget96 keyboard. All are as-used for the GB production unless otherwise noted as asjusted or modded.  

Included in this are:

 - Middle slice files: Available in DXF and SVG.
 
 - Hirpro slice files: Not on hand at the moment, will be requesting copies from Jolimon to add shortly. 
 
 - Top/bottom plate files: Available in DXF, Kicad project files, or Gerbers ready for fab. Note on the Kicad project files, both top and bottom are their own components that will need to be added to the project when opened if they don't appear automatically. 
 
 
 I'll be adding a list of used hardware shortly, I need to check back through to verify some of it.
