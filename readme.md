Repository for supporting files for the Budget96 keyboard. 

Included in this are:

 - Middle slice files: Usually denoted by "mid" and available in DXF and SVG, mostly for laser cutting use. 
 
 - Hirpro slice files: Not on hand at the moment, will be requesting copies from Jolimon to add shortly. 
 
 - Top/bottom plate files: Available in DXF, Kicad project files, or Gerbers ready for fab. These are exactly as they were when made for the GB boards. Note on the Kicad project files, both top and bottom are their own components that will need to be added to the project when opened if they don't appear automatically.
